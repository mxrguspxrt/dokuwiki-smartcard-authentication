HOW TO INSTALL

PRECONDITIONS

1. You have configured your Apache as follows:

  ...
  # this is under virtualhost :443 section
  # your webserver public and private cert
  SSLCertificateFile    /etc/ssl/certs/www.domain.ee.crt
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/www.domain.ee.key
  # This makes certain, that its valid smartcard and is allowed (google for
  # ID kaart + apache server)
  SSLCACertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/id.crt
  ...

If you want that before opening Wiki user certificate is asked and autolog
is done, add also these lines to your Virtualhost config or .htaccess file
in Wiki root:

...
  # request client cert
  SSLVerifyClient require
  SSLVerifyDepth 2
  SSLOptions +StdEnvVars +ExportCertData
  ...

2. Using .htaccess is allowed (if it is not allowed, you have to copy
inc/auth/smartcard/.htaccess content to virtualhost directory section for
inc/auth/smartcard)

3. If your value against what your would like to check is not in
certificate.subject.serialNumber, you will have to change
inc/auth/smartcard.php line 85.
STEPS

   1. svn checkout
https://dokuwiki-smartcard-authentication.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/
dokuwiki-smartcard-authentication
   2. cp -a dokuwiki-smartcard-authentication/dokuwiki/*
YOUR_DOKUWIKI_INSTALLATION (Copy content to Dokuwiki installation directory)
   3. Configure authentication module (See: "Configure parameters")
   4. Make Smartcard autentication available for user
          * Add to your wiki what would reference to
          * https://YOUR_DOMAIN/DOKUWIKI_PATH/inc/auth/smartcard
            Modify in
            YOUR_DOKUWIKI_INSTALLATION/inc/lang/YOUR_CHOSEN_LANGUAGE/login.txt
            and add line: To log in with smart card, click:
            [[inc/auth/smartcard|Autenticate me with Smartcard]] 

HOW TO ALLOW SMARTCARD AUTH

You have to do:

   1. Mark user serial (or some other parameter for check) as one of his
groups. 

This auth module will authenticated user based on the serial found on
smartcard with steps:

   1. If ?u=smartcard&p=smartcard is called script check that
certificate.subject.serialNumber exists (from $_SERVER['SSL_CLIENT_S_DN')
          * if it exists: user, who has this value as his group, is allowed
            in
          * if it does not exist: user is not allowed in 
   2. If auth is called with other parameters and
$conf['smartcard']['allow_without_smartcard'] is checked
          * if it is true: auth is delegated to auth modules defined in
            $conf['smartcard']['use_authtypes']
          * else login with username and password will not be possible. 

CONFIGURE PARAMETERS

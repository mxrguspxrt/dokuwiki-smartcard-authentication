  * 2011 07 20 - Added canDo['logout']=>true for 2011-05-25, so logging out would work
  * 2011 02 15 - SSL_CLIENT_S_DN instead of SSL_CLIENT_CERT is used (due
  * headers can't be multiline and behind proxy SSL_CLIENT_CERT is not
  * available in correct format), added few language files for en, et, uk
  * and ru.
  * 2010 05 22 - Added info message if Smartcard cert was not found
  * 2010 05 22 - Added session_start() to inc/auth/smartcard/index.php to
  * solve auth fail when session.auto_start=0
  * 2010 05 18 - Fixed that some plugin forced re-auth, before session and
  * cookies were set, auth failed.
  * 2010 04 26 - initial release

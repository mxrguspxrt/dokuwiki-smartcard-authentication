= Installation =

=== Preconditions ===

1. You have configured your Apache as follows:
{{{ 
<VirtualHost IP:443> 
  ...
  # this is under virtualhost :443 section
  # your webserver public and private cert
  SSLCertificateFile    /etc/ssl/certs/www.domain.ee.crt
  SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/ssl/private/www.domain.ee.key
  # This makes certain, that its valid smartcard and is allowed (google for ID kaart + apache server)
  SSLCACertificateFile /etc/ssl/certs/id.crt
  ...
</VirtualHost>
}}}

If you want that before opening Wiki user certificate is asked and autolog is done, add also these lines to your Virtualhost config or .htaccess file in Wiki root:
{{{
...
# request client cert
SSLVerifyClient require
SSLVerifyDepth 2
SSLOptions +StdEnvVars +ExportCertData
...
}}}

2. Using .htaccess must be allowed. If it is not allowed, you have to copy inc/auth/smartcard/.htaccess content to virtualhost directory section for inc/auth/smartcard:

{{{
<VirtualHost IP:443>
  ...
  # Usally using Directory instead of Location is recommended, 
  # but this is not for security, but for asking certificate
  <Location "/inc/auth/smartcard">
    SSLVerifyClient Optional
    SSLVerifyDepth 2
    SSLOptions +StdEnvVars +ExportCertData
  </Location>
...
</VirtualHost>
}}}



3. If your value against what your would like to check is not in certificate.subject.serialNumber, you will have to change `inc/auth/smartcard.php` line 85.

=== Steps ===

  # cd your_dokuwiki_folder
  # svn export https://dokuwiki-smartcard-authentication.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/dokuwiki/ . --force
  # Configure authentication module (See: "Configure parameters")
  # Make Smartcard autentication available for user
    * Add to your wiki what would reference to https://YOUR_DOMAIN/DOKUWIKI_PATH/inc/auth/smartcard
    * Modify in YOUR_DOKUWIKI_INSTALLATION/inc/lang/YOUR_CHOSEN_LANGUAGE/login.txt and add line: `To log in with smart card, click: [[inc/auth/smartcard|Autenticate me with Smartcard]]`
  # Clear your Dokuwiki cache 



= Allowing Smartcard authentication =

You have to do:
  # Mark user serial (or some other parameter for check) as one of his groups.

This auth module will authenticated user based on the serial found on smartcard with steps:
  # If ?u=smartcard&p=smartcard is called script check that `certificate.subject.serialNumber` exists (from `$_SERVER['SSL_CLIENT_S_DN'`)
    * if it exists: user, who has this value as his group, is allowed in
    * if it does not exist: user is not allowed in
  # If auth is called with other parameters and `$conf['smartcard']['allow_without_smartcard']` is checked
    * if it is `true`: auth is delegated to auth modules defined in `$conf['smartcard']['use_authtypes']`
    * else login with username and password will not be possible.
  



= Configuration =

Must be defined in file: YOUR_WIKI_INSTALLATION/conf/local.php.

Config parameters explanation:

{{{ 
  # set for docuwiki that smartcard auth module is used
  $conf['authtype']   = 'smartcard';

  # if this is set to true, without smartcard login is not allowed
  $conf['auth']['smartcard']['allow_without_smartcard'] = 'true';

  # auth modules to use. separated with comma (",")
  $conf['auth']['smartcard']['use_authtypes'] = 'plain,mysql';

  # log debug info to file
  $conf['auth']['smartcard']['log_to_file'] = 'true';
}}}

= Known problems =
  * When using Fckglite WYSIWYG editor, first login fails - because fckglite resets session - fix info: http://code.google.com/p/dokuwiki-smartcard-authentication/issues/detail?id=1
